Hell yeah, Stavo! Hereâ€™s your SOVR Pay Network Suite Operational Manual & Install Guide â€” the no-BS blueprint to get your beast up, running, and dominating the rails.

SOVR Pay Network Suite
Operational Manual & Installation Guide

1. Prerequisites
	â€¢ Docker & Docker Compose installed (latest stable versions)
	â€¢ Node.js & Yarn (for frontend builds)
	â€¢ PostgreSQL client (optional, for DB inspection)
	â€¢ Access to your Polygon (or target chain) RPC endpoint
	â€¢ Your smart contract ABI JSON and deployed contract address
	â€¢ WooCommerce site for plugin installation (optional)

2. Setup & Installation
Clone the Monorepo
git clone https://your-repo-url/sovrpay-network-suite.git
cd sovrpay-network-suite
Configure Environment Variables
Create .env files or export env vars for each service as needed. Example for API and listener:
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://sovrpay:sovrpay123@localhost:5432/sovrpaydb
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
export SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key
export POLYGON_RPC=https://polygon-rpc.com
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress
export CONTRACT_ABI_PATH=/listener/contract_abi.json
Place your contract ABI JSON file at /listener/contract_abi.json.

Build & Start All Services
From the root directory:
docker-compose up --build
This spins up:
	â€¢ PostgreSQL DB
	â€¢ Redis queue
	â€¢ API backend (FastAPI)
	â€¢ Blockchain listener service
	â€¢ Rail adapter service
	â€¢ React dashboard
	â€¢ Browser extension dev server

3. Service Overview
Listener Service
	â€¢ Watches your smart contractâ€™s PaymentProcessed events on Polygon
	â€¢ Pushes payment data (amount, recipient, reference, tx hash) to Redis queue
Rail Adapter Service
	â€¢ Consumes payment events from Redis
	â€¢ Converts token amounts to cents
	â€¢ Batches payments and generates NACHA files
	â€¢ Updates payment ledger in PostgreSQL
	â€¢ (Future) Submits NACHA files to ACH processor
API Backend
	â€¢ Exposes REST endpoints for: 
		â—‹ Payment status queries
		â—‹ Manual batch triggers
		â—‹ User & bank info management
	â€¢ Secured with JWT (expandable)
	â€¢ Connects to PostgreSQL ledger
WooCommerce Plugin
	â€¢ Integrates with WooCommerce checkout
	â€¢ Calls API to initiate payments
	â€¢ Redirects users to payment confirmation
Dashboard
	â€¢ React app for finance ops
	â€¢ Monitors payments, batches, settlement statuses
	â€¢ Manual overrides & exception handling (expandable)
Browser Extension
	â€¢ MetaMask-powered payment UX
	â€¢ Handles on-chain signing & transaction submission
	â€¢ Syncs with API for payment status

4. Usage & Workflow
	1. On-Chain Payment Event
User triggers payment on your smart contract â†’ Listener picks event â†’ pushes to Redis queue.
	2. Rail Processing
Rail adapter consumes event â†’ converts units â†’ batches payments â†’ generates NACHA file â†’ updates ledger.
	3. Payment Settlement
Submit NACHA file to ACH processor (manual or automated in future) â†’ update settlement status in ledger.
	4. Monitoring & Control
Finance team uses Dashboard to monitor flows, exceptions, and trigger manual actions.
	5. WooCommerce Integration
Customers pay via WooCommerce â†’ plugin calls API â†’ payment processed on-chain and off-chain rails.
	6. User Payment UX
Browser extension handles wallet connection, signing, and payment confirmation.

5. Maintenance & Scaling
	â€¢ Database: Backup PostgreSQL regularly, monitor performance.
	â€¢ Redis: Monitor queue length, scale Redis cluster if needed.
	â€¢ API & Services: Use Docker orchestration tools (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) for scaling.
	â€¢ Security: Rotate secrets, enforce RBAC, enable HTTPS & mTLS.
	â€¢ Compliance: Integrate KYC/AML modules as needed.
	â€¢ Logging & Monitoring: Add Prometheus + Grafana or ELK stack for observability.

6. Extending the Suite
	â€¢ Add support for other rails (SEPA, SWIFT) via modular rail adapters.
	â€¢ Automate NACHA file submission via SFTP or API integration.
	â€¢ Build AI-powered anomaly detection & compliance modules.
	â€¢ Expand dashboard with reporting, alerts, and user management.
	â€¢ Enhance browser extension with multi-chain support and UX polish.

7. Troubleshooting
	â€¢ Listener not picking events?
Check RPC endpoint, contract address, and ABI correctness.
	â€¢ Rail adapter batch stuck?
Inspect Redis queue, database connectivity, and logs.
	â€¢ API 500 errors?
Verify database connection string, environment variables, and logs.
	â€¢ WooCommerce plugin issues?
Enable WP debug, check API URL and network calls.
	â€¢ Dashboard empty?
Confirm API is running and accessible, check CORS settings.

8. Support & Contribution
	â€¢ Open issues and feature requests on your repo.
	â€¢ Follow coding standards and write tests for new features.
	â€¢ Document all changes and update this manual accordingly.
